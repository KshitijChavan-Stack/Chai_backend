-> first need to know public/private key cryptography
- public can be destributed and if the data is encrypted with it, the decryption will be done with our private key only
- private key concept is important, and JWT work on same
- another concept we should know is stateless and stateful 
- we'll not store the state of this in any file or DB
- JWT is a statless machanism
- this means who ever have the token are the one who have the access/authority
- EXAMPLE -eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWUsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.KMUFsIDTnFmyG3nMiGM6H9FNFUROf3wh7SmqJp-QV30
- FIrst part -> The algo thats used
- Second part -> The info/data -> Payload data
- / we also add expire time with each token
- Third part -> signature part(madeup of first and second part + our secret key)

Authentication v/s Authorization
->Authentication 
- this is just verifyication
- when we give our details to authenticate thats this is me ! 
- This doesn't mean you'll get the resource access

-> Authorization 
- defined to give resource access

Questions regarding  JWT
1. how do you securely store JWT on the client-side ?
- > JWT works like short lived token, who ever it has can access ! there are option where we can store the JWT token 1. storing in local storage(less secure) ,2. Session storage, 3. can also be stored in Cookies(JS cannot access this) but,
most great way is to expire it in some time period !

2.What are the common usecases of JWT ?
-> first is for authentication, info exchange we can add the payload,server-server can also comunicate

3.How can you invalidate a JWT?
-> By every token is created we get a token expire,for every implementaion, we can determine the time span we want it exprire
